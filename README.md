# Zeek

Zeek (formerly known as Bro) is a powerful network analysis framework that is much different from the typical IDS you probably know. Here are some key points about Zeek:

### Features:
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Zeek monitors network traffic and provides a high-level overview of network activities.
- **Event-Driven:** It processes network events and can generate logs or trigger other actions based on these events.
- **Highly Flexible:** Zeek is highly customizable and users can write scripts to define how it analyzes network traffic.

### Installation:
To install Zeek on a Linux system, you can follow these steps:

1. **Update Package Lists:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install cmake make gcc g++ flex bison libpcap-dev libssl-dev python3 python3-dev swig zlib1g-dev
   ```

3. **Download Zeek:**
   ```bash
   wget https://download.zeek.org/zeek-4.0.0.tar.gz
   tar -xvzf zeek-4.0.0.tar.gz
   cd zeek-4.0.0
   ```

4. **Compile and Install:**
   ```bash
   ./configure
   make
   sudo make install
   ```

5. **Verify Installation:**
   ```bash
   zeek --version
   ```

### Basic Usage:
To start analyzing network traffic, you can run Zeek with the following command:
```bash
sudo zeek -i <interface>
```
Replace `<interface>` with the network interface you want to monitor (e.g., `eth0`).

### Writing Zeek Scripts:
Zeek uses its own scripting language for defining how to analyze traffic. Here's a simple example of a Zeek script that logs HTTP requests:

```zeek
event http_request(c: connection, method: string, original_URI: string, unescaped_URI: string, version: string) {
    print fmt("HTTP request: %s %s", method, unescaped_URI);
}
```

- [Zeek Scripts](https://github.com/zeek/scripts)

Zeek is a powerful tool for network security monitoring and analysis, and learning to use it can significantly enhance your ability to understand and protect your network.
