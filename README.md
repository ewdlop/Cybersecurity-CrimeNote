# OpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment System), is an open-source framework for comprehensive network vulnerability scanning and management. It is part of the Greenbone Vulnerability Manager (GVM) framework. Below are the steps to install and use OpenVAS on an Ubuntu system:

### Installation

#### Prerequisites

Update your package lists and install necessary dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common
```

#### Add the GVM/OpenVAS PPA

Add the Greenbone PPA to your system:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mrazavi/gvm
sudo apt-get update
```

#### Install OpenVAS

Install the OpenVAS package:

```bash
sudo apt-get install gvm
```

#### Initialize OpenVAS

Initialize the setup, which will download and configure the necessary components:

```bash
sudo gvm-setup
```

This process can take some time as it downloads the latest vulnerability feeds and configures the services.

#### Start OpenVAS Services

Start the OpenVAS services:

```bash
sudo gvm-start
```

### Accessing OpenVAS

Once the installation and setup are complete, you can access the OpenVAS web interface. Open a web browser and navigate to:

```
https://<your-server-ip>:9392
```

Use the default credentials (which you can change later) to log in:

- **Username:** admin
- **Password:** admin

### Using OpenVAS

#### Scanning for Vulnerabilities

1. **Create a Target:**
   - Go to `Configuration` -> `Targets`.
   - Click on the `+` button to create a new target.
   - Enter the target details (e.g., IP address or hostname) and save.

2. **Create a Task:**
   - Go to `Scans` -> `Tasks`.
   - Click on the `+` button to create a new task.
   - Enter the task details and select the target you created earlier.
   - Save the task.

3. **Start the Scan:**
   - Select the task you created and click the `Start` button to initiate the scan.

#### Viewing Reports

After the scan is complete, you can view the results:

1. Go to `Scans` -> `Reports`.
2. Select the report for the scan you want to review.
3. The report will provide details on the vulnerabilities found, including severity and suggested remediation steps.

### Updating OpenVAS

To keep OpenVAS up-to-date with the latest vulnerability definitions and software updates, run the following commands regularly:

```bash
sudo gvm-feed-update
```

### Resources

- [GVM Documentation](https://greenbone.github.io/docs/)
- [Greenbone Community Edition](https://community.greenbone.net/)
- [Greenbone Source Edition](https://www.greenbone.net/en/testnow/)

By following these steps, you can effectively install, configure, and use OpenVAS to enhance your network security posture.

# Zeek

Zeek (formerly known as Bro) is a powerful network analysis framework that is much different from the typical IDS you probably know. Here are some key points about Zeek:

### Features:
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Zeek monitors network traffic and provides a high-level overview of network activities.
- **Event-Driven:** It processes network events and can generate logs or trigger other actions based on these events.
- **Highly Flexible:** Zeek is highly customizable and users can write scripts to define how it analyzes network traffic.

### Installation:
To install Zeek on a Linux system, you can follow these steps:

1. **Update Package Lists:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install cmake make gcc g++ flex bison libpcap-dev libssl-dev python3 python3-dev swig zlib1g-dev
   ```

3. **Download Zeek:**
   ```bash
   wget https://download.zeek.org/zeek-4.0.0.tar.gz
   tar -xvzf zeek-4.0.0.tar.gz
   cd zeek-4.0.0
   ```

4. **Compile and Install:**
   ```bash
   ./configure
   make
   sudo make install
   ```

5. **Verify Installation:**
   ```bash
   zeek --version
   ```

### Basic Usage:
To start analyzing network traffic, you can run Zeek with the following command:
```bash
sudo zeek -i <interface>
```
Replace `<interface>` with the network interface you want to monitor (e.g., `eth0`).

### Writing Zeek Scripts:
Zeek uses its own scripting language for defining how to analyze traffic. Here's a simple example of a Zeek script that logs HTTP requests:

```zeek
event http_request(c: connection, method: string, original_URI: string, unescaped_URI: string, version: string) {
    print fmt("HTTP request: %s %s", method, unescaped_URI);
}
```

### Resources:

- [Zeek Scripts](https://github.com/zeek/scripts)
- [Zeek User Mailing List](https://lists.zeek.org/mailman/listinfo/zeek)

Zeek is a powerful tool for network security monitoring and analysis, and learning to use it can significantly enhance your ability to understand and protect your network.
