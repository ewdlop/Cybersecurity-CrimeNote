OpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment System) includes a comprehensive and constantly updated vulnerability knowledge base to identify and assess vulnerabilities in systems and networks. This knowledge base is essential for the effectiveness of OpenVAS in detecting and reporting potential security issues.

### Key Components of OpenVAS Vulnerability Knowledge

1. **Network Vulnerability Tests (NVTs):**
   - OpenVAS uses a collection of Network Vulnerability Tests (NVTs) to scan for vulnerabilities.
   - NVTs are small scripts written in the Nessus Attack Scripting Language (NASL), a domain-specific language designed for vulnerability testing.

2. **Greenbone Security Feed (GSF):**
   - The Greenbone Security Feed provides the latest NVTs and is regularly updated to include new vulnerabilities as they are discovered.
   - The feed is maintained by Greenbone Networks and includes over 50,000 NVTs.

3. **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE):**
   - OpenVAS uses CVE Identifiers to reference known vulnerabilities.
   - Each vulnerability detected by OpenVAS is typically associated with a CVE ID, which provides a standardized reference for identifying and discussing vulnerabilities.

4. **Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS):**
   - OpenVAS uses CVSS scores to rate the severity of detected vulnerabilities.
   - CVSS provides a quantitative way to measure the risk associated with vulnerabilities, with scores ranging from 0.0 to 10.0, where 10.0 is the most severe.

### How OpenVAS Knowledge Base Works

1. **Updating the Knowledge Base:**
   - Regular updates are crucial to ensure OpenVAS can detect the latest vulnerabilities.
   - Use the following command to manually update the vulnerability feeds:

     ```bash
     sudo gvm-feed-update
     ```

2. **Performing Scans:**
   - OpenVAS uses the updated NVTs to perform thorough scans of your network and systems.
   - It checks for known vulnerabilities and assesses the security posture of the scanned assets.

3. **Generating Reports:**
   - After completing a scan, OpenVAS generates detailed reports that list the vulnerabilities found, their CVE IDs, CVSS scores, and recommended remediation actions.
   - These reports help administrators understand the security issues and take appropriate actions to mitigate risks.

### Using OpenVAS Knowledge in Practice

1. **Creating and Running a Scan:**
   - Login to the OpenVAS web interface at `https://<your-server-ip>:9392`.
   - Create a new scan task by navigating to `Scans` -> `Tasks` and clicking the `+` button.
   - Configure the scan task by selecting the target systems and scan configurations.
   - Start the scan and wait for it to complete.

2. **Reviewing Scan Results:**
   - After the scan is complete, go to `Scans` -> `Reports` to view the results.
   - The report will detail all detected vulnerabilities, including their severity and potential impact.

3. **Responding to Vulnerabilities:**
   - Use the CVE IDs and CVSS scores provided in the reports to prioritize remediation efforts.
   - Apply patches, update configurations, or take other security measures as recommended.
