Suricata primarily uses its own rule language for defining detection and alerting rules. However, it also supports the use of the Lua scripting language to extend its functionality. Lua scripts can be used for complex detection logic, protocol parsing, and custom actions that are not easily achievable with standard Suricata rules.

### Using Lua Scripts with Suricata

#### Prerequisites
Ensure that Suricata is compiled with Lua support. You can check this with the following command:

```bash
suricata --build-info | grep LUA
```

If Lua support is enabled, you should see output indicating the Lua version. If not, you may need to recompile Suricata with Lua support.

#### Lua Script Example

Here's a basic example of a Lua script that can be used with Suricata to detect a specific pattern in HTTP traffic:

1. **Create the Lua Script:**

   Create a file named `http.lua`:

   ```lua
   function init(args)
      local needs = {}
      needs["protocol"] = "http"
      return needs
   end

   function setup()
   end

   function match(args)
      local http_uri = tostring(args["http.uri"])
      if http_uri and string.find(http_uri, "suspicious-pattern") then
         return 1
      end
      return 0
   end

   function done()
   end
   ```

2. **Configure Suricata to Use the Lua Script:**

   Edit the Suricata configuration file (`/etc/suricata/suricata.yaml`) to include the Lua script:

   ```yaml
   app-layer:
     protocols:
       http:
         enabled: yes
         lua:
           - script: /path/to/http.lua
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/http.lua` with the actual path to your Lua script.

3. **Restart Suricata:**

   Restart Suricata to apply the configuration changes:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart suricata
   ```

### Using Lua Scripts in Suricata Rules

Suricata rules can invoke Lua scripts to perform more advanced processing. Hereâ€™s how you can create a rule that uses a Lua script:

1. **Create a Lua Script:**

   Create a file named `custom_rule.lua`:

   ```lua
   function init(args)
      return {}
   end

   function match(args)
      local payload = tostring(args["payload"])
      if payload and string.find(payload, "malicious-pattern") then
         return 1
      end
      return 0
   end
   ```

2. **Refer to the Lua Script in a Suricata Rule:**

   Add a Suricata rule that calls the Lua script:

   ```plaintext
   alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"Custom Lua Rule Triggered"; lua:custom_rule.lua; sid:1000005; rev:1;)
   ```

3. **Update Suricata Configuration:**

   Ensure that the Suricata configuration file includes the path to your Lua script:

   ```yaml
   detection:
     enabled: yes
     lua:
       - script: /path/to/custom_rule.lua
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/custom_rule.lua` with the actual path to your Lua script.

4. **Restart Suricata:**

   Restart Suricata to load and apply the new rule and script:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart suricata
   ```
